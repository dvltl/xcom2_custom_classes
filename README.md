# xcom2_custom_classes
Contains config files for my XCOM 2 WOTC custom classes.
To use them you'd need the following mods installed:
* Extended perk pack;
* LW2 perk pack;
* Mitzruti's perk pack;
* LW2 Secondaries;
* Primary Secondaries;
* Ketaros 2D Package.

You can add them to the files of the exsting class mods.
They were created this way because I wanted to make a couple of classes on my own but didn't want to install 100Gb worth of SDK.
